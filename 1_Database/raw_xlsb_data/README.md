## Data Acquisition

The raw data for this project were manually sourced from the [Vipunen.fi](https://vipunen.fi/en-gb/) data portal.

Due to the portal's architecture, a repeatable process was established to download 100+ individual `.xlsb` report files, each filtered by year, gender, and age group from the ``Appicants and selected candidates`` category.

These raw files will not be found here (due to their size and to maintain best practices).
The raw data can be processed by the `process_xlsb_data.py` script located in the parent directory.
